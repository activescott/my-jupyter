## Usage
TODO

## Development

### Tests
Run tests via `test.sh`. See the `test_*.py` files.

### Build

Run the `build-package.sh` script to build and optionally publish it.

### Publish

In this context "Publish" means to basically inject it into the Jupyter Docker container image. See `publish-package-to-docker-image.sh` for how that works.
